# Lesson 1: Introduction to Data Science

## What is Data Science?

- [slide deck 1 for lesson 1 - L01-A-WhatIsDataScience.pdf](https://library.startlearninglabs.uw.edu/DATASCI400/PDF/L01-A-WhatIsDataScience.pdf)

### Intro (deck 1, slides 1-4)
> Data science is the generalization of the scientific method

with the advent of technology everyone now has the opportunity/capability to use the scientific methods to figure things out

for next week: "Every data set is a sparse multi-dimensional matrix"

### Scientific method (deck 1, slides 5-8)

- "if you can't test it - then it's not a hypothesis" => requires testable hypothesis
- Schema is another name for the space (slide 10)
- each data point would be a row in a data table, column for x and column for y
- model is a representation of the data
- a hypothesis can be a model

> "All models are wrong but some are useful" - George Box

> "Predictive accuracy on test sets is the criterion for how good the model is" - Leo Breiman

Leo Breiman creatd the Random Forest algorthim

#### Some Terminiology (deck 1, slide 17)

- Data + Algorthim = Model
- Model and Hypothesis can be conflasted (set equal to each other)
- Model + More data = prediction

## What is Data in Data Science
- [slide deck 2 for lesson 1 - L01-A-2-ScienceandData.pdf](https://library.startlearninglabs.uw.edu/DATASCI400/PDF/L01-A-2-ScienceandData.pdf)

_(deck 2, slide 7)_
Data are observations that are put into context. Given that every observation has a context, an observation is a datum.

_(deck 2, slide 8)_
Unstructured data does not exist.
– The essence of data is that they are structured.
– The context is what makes data.

_(deck 2, slide 9)_
Q: What is meant by Unstructured
Data?
A: poorly structured data that are hard to
analyze

_(deck 2, slide 19)_ intro to the four analyaicts
1. Descriptive: What Happened?
2. Diagnostic: Why did it happen?
3. Predictive: What will happen?
4. Perscriptive: What should I do?
